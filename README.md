# Image-Classification

*A Deep Learning Web App built with Flask*

## Background
*The ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) evaluates algorithms for object detection and image classification at large scale. One high level motivation is to allow researchers to compare progress in detection across a wider variety of objects -- taking advantage of the quite expensive labeling effort. Another motivation is to measure the progress of computer vision for large scale image indexing for retrieval and annotation.*

## Problem Statement
*We need to use any of the Transfer Learning ImageNet algorithm to predict the class of any kind of image given as an input by the user.*

## Data Set
*You can download the data set from image-net.org - http://image-net.org/download*

## Number of Attributes
*There is only one attribute which is to be given by the user, which is the image itself and it can be in either of the .png, .jpg or .jpeg format.*

## Algorithm
VGG-19 Convolutional Neural Network - *VGG means Visual Geometry Group at University of Oxford. The Convolutional neural networks they developed for winning the ImageNet Challenge 2014 in localization and classification tasks are known as VGG nets. VGG-19 is a convolutional neural network that is 19 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals. As a result, the network has learned rich feature representations for a wide range of images. The network has an image input size of 224-by-224.*
